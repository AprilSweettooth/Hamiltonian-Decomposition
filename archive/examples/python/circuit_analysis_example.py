# # Circuit analysis: tket example

# This notebook will introduce the basic methods of analysis and visualization of circuits available in `pytket`.
#
# It makes use of the modules `pytket_qiskit` and `pytket_cirq` for visualization; these need to be installed (with `pip`) in addition to `pytket`.
#
# We'll start by generating a small circuit to use as an example, and give it a name.

from pytket.circuit import Circuit, OpType

c = Circuit(4, name="example")
c.add_gate(OpType.CU1, 0.5, [0, 1])
c.H(0).X(1).Y(2).Z(3)
c.X(0).CX(1, 2).Y(1).Z(2).H(3)
c.Y(0).Z(1)
c.add_gate(OpType.CU1, 0.5, [2, 3])
c.H(2).X(3)
c.Z(0).H(1).X(2).Y(3).CX(3, 0)

# ## Basic statistics

# From the circuit we can easily read off the number of qubits ...

c.n_qubits

# ... the name ...

c.name

# ... the overall depth of the circuit ...

c.depth()

# ... and the depth by type of gate:

from pytket.circuit import OpType

c.depth_by_type(OpType.CU1), c.depth_by_type(OpType.H)

# This last method counts the number of instances of the specified gate type that cannot be parallelized. Notice that although there are 4 H gates in the circuit, the H-depth is 2 because pairs of them can be parallelized (as will be clear from the visualizations below).

# ## Visualization

# There are several ways to produce useful visualizations of circuits from `pytket`: we can use the methods in the `pytket.circuit.display` class; we can use the built-in `Graph` class to visualize the circuit as a directed acyclic graph (DAG); we can convert the circuit to either Qiskit or Cirq and use the tools provided by those modules; or we can export to Latex.

# ### Via the `render_circuit_jupyter` method

from pytket.circuit.display import render_circuit_jupyter

render_circuit_jupyter(c)

# Notice that although the `render_circuit_jupyter` method is the recommended way to render a circuit as jupyter cell output, one of the other methods should be used when working with scripts or python shells.

# ### Via the `Graph` class

from pytket.utils import Graph

G = Graph(c)
G.get_DAG()

# The small numbers (0 and 1) shown at the entry to and exit from the two-qubit gates represent "port numbers" on the gates; these allow us to track individual qubits, which may be placed in a different order on entry and exit in order to simplify the layout.
#
# The `Graph` class also has methods to save this image to a file and to open it in a PDF viewer.
#
# We can also view the qubit connectivity graph of a circuit:

G.get_qubit_graph()

# ### Via Qiskit

from pytket.extensions.qiskit import tk_to_qiskit

print(tk_to_qiskit(c))

# ### Via Cirq

from pytket.extensions.cirq import tk_to_cirq

print(tk_to_cirq(c))

# (Note that Cirq cannot represent all gates diagrammatically.)

# ### Via Latex

# We can create a Latex document containing a diagram of the circuit using the `to_latex_file()` method. This uses the `quantikz` library. The document can be viewed on its own or the Latex can easily be copied and pasted into a larger document.

c.to_latex_file("c.tex")

# ## Commands

# We can retrieve a list of operations comprising a circuit, each represented as a `Command` object:

cmds = c.get_commands()
print(cmds)

# Each `Command` is defined by an operation and the qubits it operates on (as well as the classical bits and conditions, if any). For example:

cmd0 = cmds[0]
op0 = cmd0.op
print(op0)
qubits0 = cmd0.args
print(qubits0)

# From the `Op` we can read off the string representation (in normal or Latex form), the parameters and the type:

op0.get_name()  # normal form

op0.get_name(latex=True)  # Latex form

op0.type, op0.params

# Note that some compilation passes introduce implicit wire swaps at the end of the circuit, which are not represented in the command list. (The internal representation of the circuit as a directed acyclic graph reduces explicit permutations of qubits to implicit features of the graph.)
