# # Calibration and Correction of State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM)

# Quantum Computers available in the NISQ-era are limited by significant sources of device noise which cause errors in computation. One such noise source is errors in the preparation and measurement of quantum states, more commonly know as SPAM.
#
# If device SPAM error can be characterised, then device results can be modified to mitigate the error. Characterisation proceeds by determining overlap between different prepared basis states when measured, and mitigation modifies the distribution over output states of the corrected circuit. No modification of the quantum circuit being corrected is required. The ``` pytket```  ```SpamCorrecter```  class supports characterisation and mitigation of device SPAM error.
#
# In this tutorial we will show how the ```SpamCorrecter```  class can be used to modify real results and improve device performance when running experiments.
#
# This tutorial will require installation of ```pytket```, ```pytket_qiskit``` and ```qiskit```, all available on pip.
#
# First, import the ```SpamCorrecter``` class.

from pytket.utils.spam import SpamCorrecter

# The SpamCorrecter class has methods for generating State Preparation and Measurement (SPAM) calibration experiments for pytket backends and correcting counts generated from those same backends.
#
# Let's first mitigate error from a noisy simulation, using a noise model straight from the 5-qubit IBMQ manila device. This will require a preloaded IBMQ account.

# SPAM correction requires subsets of qubits which are assumed to only have SPAM errors correlated with each other, and no other qubits.
#
# Correlated errors are usually dependent on the connectivity layout of devices, as shown above.
#
# As manila is a small 5-qubit device with few connections, let's assume that all qubits have correlated SPAM errors. The number of calibration circuits produced is exponential in the maximum number of correlated circuits, so finding good subsets of correlated qubits is important for characterising larger devices with smaller experimental overhead.
#
# We can produce an ```IBMQEmulatorBackend``` to run this. This uses a noise model from ```ibmq_manila``` produced using qiskit-aer. We can then execute all calibration circuits through the backend.
